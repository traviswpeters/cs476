This is just a stub that redirects to the website for the appropriate course/semester.

To change where [https://www.traviswpeters.com/cs476/](https://www.traviswpeters.com/cs476/) redirects to,
modify the following line in `index.md`:

```
redirect_to:  https://www.traviswpeters.com/cs476-2020-spring/
```

(If you copy this repo to setup a redirect for a different course, you'll also want to update `_config.yml` accordingly.)
